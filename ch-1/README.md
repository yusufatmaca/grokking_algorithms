## Questions

- What is the definition of **algorithm**?
- Define the **search problem.** Give different examples or scenarios.
- Define **binary search** problem. Which problem can be solved with binary search? Which problem *potentially* cannot be solved with binary search?
- Define the **time complexity** of the binary search. And also prove!
- Think about if the array has an **even** number of elements, and also think about if the array has an **odd** number of elements... Explain and prove that there will be no changes in the algorithm.
- What is the definition of **linear time**? Give an example algorithm to it.
- What is the definition of **logarithmic time**? Give an example algorithm to it.
- Define **Big O** notation. What Big O does tell us and what Big O does not tell us. Explain.
- You want to read the numbers of just the *A‚Äôs* on the phone book. Give the run time of this scenario in terms of Big O (e*xercise 1.6, p.17*).
- Explain the **Travelling Salesperson Problem**. Give Big O time. *Can Dijkstra's algorithm be applied to the Travelling Salesperson Problem?*
